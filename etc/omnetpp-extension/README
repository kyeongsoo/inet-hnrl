This directory includes various files extending the original OMNeT++ ver. 4.0
(as of 2009-10-22).

Before starting "make" in the original omnetpp root directory, copy (& overwrite)
the files under "root" directory to the original root directory. The whole
OMNeT++ updating process can be done using the shell script ("omnetpp_update")
on the same directory where this file is located.


* Notes:
OMNeT++ 4.0 user manual has en error in the description of probability distributions
in Sec. 6.4.4 (page 126 of PDF version):

"lognormal(m, s, rng=0) | lognormal distribution with mean m and variance s>0"

It should be changed as follows:

"lognormal(m, s, rng=0) | lognormal distribution corresponding to a normal distribution
                          with mean m and standard deviation s>0"
